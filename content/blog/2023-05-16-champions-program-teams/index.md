description: "Introducing Champions and Mentors - Alican Cagri Gokcek and Elio Campitelli"
---

*We designed the [rOpenSci Champions Program](/champions/) with a mentorship aspect. Mentoring plays a significant role in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees alike. In our program, each Champion has a mentor who accompanies them during their training and development of their project.*

*In this series of blog posts, we introduce you to the ten teams of this first cohort and what they will be working on in the program.*

Meet **Alican Cagri Gokcek** from Argentina and **Elio Campitelli** from United Kingdom!

My name is Alican Cagri Gokcek. I am originally from Turkey, and live in the United States right now. I am a visually impaired person since the birth. I have a BA and MA in the department of Political Science and International Relations at Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey where I also spent three more years as a Ph.D. student before coming to the United States to start my new Ph.D. training from scratch in the department of Political Science at the University of Nevada, Reno in August 2022. My research interests are social movements and contentious politics with a specific focus on labor, international political economy with a special interest in capitlism's crises and opportunities in contemporary world, and computational social science with a specific focus on accessibility of statistics and statistical softwares in education. In Champions Program, I aim at becoming a peer reviewer to contribute to the package evaluation processes from the point of the disabled. I believe that Champions Program sends an invaluable message to the entire R community through its inclusiveness and respect for the people with underrepresented minorities.
